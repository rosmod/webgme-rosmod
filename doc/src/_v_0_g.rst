Systems
=======

The ``Systems`` folder provides a place to group the different
``System`` definitions on which you might like to run the software
defined in the ``Software`` model. When *compiling* the software using
the ``SoftwareGenerator`` plugin from the project's *root* aspect, the
different system models are used to determine for which computer
``architectures`` to compile the software.
